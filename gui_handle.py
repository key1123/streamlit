"""
gui_handle.py

Central app navigation and main homepage.
- Launches the registration wizard on startup.
- Shows a personalized homepage after registration.
- User can open the routine scheduler GUI from here.

How this code works:
- MainApp is a Tk root window, but starts out hidden.
- RegistrationWizard is run first; on complete, home is shown.
- User info and chosen accommodations are shown on the homepage.
- "Go to Routine Scheduler" opens a Toplevel window.
